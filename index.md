### Abstract

The present project focuses on the development of Sfake, a software implementation of the well-known Snake game, chosen as our case study for its popularity, simplicity, and suitability for the application of software engineering principles. The main goal was the systematic application of best practices in software design, development, and deployment, within the context of a complete and structured workflow within the best of our capabilities.
The core mechanics replicate the traditional Snake gameplay, additional elements such as a main menu with navigation options, a scoreboard section isolated from the play area, and a temporary bomb mechanic were introduced to enrich the case study and test more complex design choices.
Beyond functionality, the focus of the project was on the adoption of software engineering methodologies. The development process integrated Domain-driven Design (DDD) to structure the domain logic, version control through Git and GitHub, semantic versioning, and towards the end continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions. The project also includes a dedicated testing strategy, with unit tests separated into model and controller layers to ensure code correctness and facilitate maintainability.
The work also addressed additional aspects required by the evaluation framework: project structure and documentation, licensing, dependency management, automated release pipelines, and deployment strategies. These practices highlight how even a simple and well-known application domain can serve as an effective environment for applying advanced development methodologies.
