## Known issues and future work

The current release of Sfake represents a complete and fully functional implementation of the classic Snake game, redesigned as an educational artifact to demonstrate professional software engineering practices. All functional and non-functional requirements defined during the analysis phase have been met, and no critical issues affecting gameplay or system stability are present. The game runs consistently across supported platforms and has passed the entire test suite.

That said, there are several opportunities for future improvement and feature expansion. A natural enhancement would be the introduction of persistent leaderboards, allowing players to track and compare scores across multiple sessions or even among different users. Another promising extension is the addition of customizable game modes, such as difficulty levels with varying snake speed or obstacle density.

Strategically, these enhancements could be rolled out incrementally: first by implementing persistent score storage and a more advanced start menu with integrated instructions, followed by new game modes. Larger-scale expansions, such as multiplayer support or integration with external APIs for online leaderboards, would represent a possible evolution towards version 2.0, demonstrating the scalability of the current architecture and its potential for continued professional development.

Another possible improvement could be the release of the application on PyPi, following a more reliable worflow pattern that what was used this time around.
