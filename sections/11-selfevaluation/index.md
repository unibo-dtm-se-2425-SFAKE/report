## Self-evaluation

### Previati Alessandro

The work was carried out correctly. We tried to divide the tasks as fairly as possible, making optimal use of the time available. Given the relatively low complexity of the project, we did not make full use of the techniques for S.E. introduced during the course, often relying on communication methods that would not be ideal for larger projects. The project itself could certainly have been improved in some areas, rather than leaving the foundation as we did, but this can serve as a point for future enhancement. Overall, the work was satisfactory, fairly distributed, and led to an acceptable outcome.
