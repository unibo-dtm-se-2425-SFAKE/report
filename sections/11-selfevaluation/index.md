## Self-evaluation

### Previati Alessandro

The work was carried out correctly. We tried to divide the tasks as fairly as possible, making optimal use of the time available. Given the relatively low complexity of the project, we did not make full use of the techniques for S.E. introduced during the course, often relying on communication methods that would not be ideal for larger projects, such as Pair Programming. The project itself could certainly have been improved in some areas, but this can serve as a point for future enhancement.
Overall, the work was satisfactory, fairly distributed, and led to an acceptable outcome.

### Berveglieri Filippo

The project was completed successfully and in accordance with the assigned objectives. We aimed to distribute the workload in a balanced way, ensuring that each team member could contribute effectively within the available time.
Since the projectâ€™s overall complexity was relatively limited, we did not make extensive use of all the Software Engineering methodologies introduced during the course. Instead, we often opted for more direct and informal forms of collaboration, such as Pair Programming, which proved efficient in this specific context but might be less suitable for larger or more structured projects.
While there are certainly aspects that could be refined or expanded in future iterations, the current outcome demonstrates a solid understanding of the required concepts and a good level of teamwork. In conclusion, the project was completed correctly, the workload was shared fairly, and the final result met expectations in a satisfactory way.
