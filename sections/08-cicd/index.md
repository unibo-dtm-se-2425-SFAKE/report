## CI/CD

Our CI/CD section of the project is based on GitHub Actions. Activated during the last commits it helped us test and deploy the latest versions as correctly as possible. The project follows the template for SE project of our course, automatically testing and deploying all the version of Python that are supposed to run the application, that goes for all the three major operating systems currently used, that are Linux, MacOS and Windows.
By using this automatic testing we are able to see if there are currently errors and on which particular version. If everything is correct and GitHub Actions doesn't show any particular problem then the updated version of the application is released.

The use of a CI/CD process can simplify and automatize a lot of the work done by developers in order to release a working software. In this case it was not used as proficiently as a bigger project would require. We didn't encounter any particular problems but the entity of the application worked in our favor.
