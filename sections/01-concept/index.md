## Concept

### Type of product

The developed artifact is a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Use case collection

The main users of the application are casual players who want to interact with a funny and intuitive game that is usually played on the phone.
The interaction occurs through two main channels: keyboard input for controlling the snakeâ€™s movement and mouse input for navigating the initial menu (Start, Quit, Rules). Users typically engage in short game sessions, lasting only a few minutes, but can repeat them as often as they wish.
The application does not require user accounts or personal data storage: only temporary variables (e.g., score, snake position, timers for temporary bombs) are kept in memory during the game. When the session ends, no information is saved. The only role is the player, while developers and maintainers interact with the system from a technical perspective to improve or extend its functionalities.
